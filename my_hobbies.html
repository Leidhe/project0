                <h3>Videogames</h3>
                <p>I love videogames. I spend hours and hours playing them on the computer in my room. I like almost
                    kind of video games like action games, shooter and mmo. But I don't like horror games too much
                    though,
                    as I get scared easily by anything.

                <h3>Sport</h3>
                <p>I think that doing sport every day is necessary for all people. I try to practice sport every day,
                    although sometimes I can't because I have too much work. I usually do running, although sometimes I
                    like to go to the pool to swim

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>I really like visit new places. When I go to a new place I usually eat the typical food there, and I
                    visit many museums or the most important tourist places. I have travelled to France and Italy, but I
                    would like to know more places in the world.
